			There are two players in Blackjack, you and the dealer (computer). <br /><br />

			Your goal is to beat the dealer by having a higher point score. Blackjack cards are
			scored by their point total. The person with the highest total score, that isnâ€™t above 21,
			wins the round. A point score higher than 21 is a loss. The cards 2 through 10 are worth
			their number value, and the face cards (jack, queen, king) are all worth 10. An ace is worth 11,
			unless this creates a total score higher than 21, in which case it is worth 1.<br /><br />

			You have two options as you play: hit or stand.<br /><br />

			Hit: You take another card, and its value gets added onto your score<br />
			Stand: You take no more cards and your current score is your final score<br /><br />

			Try to beat the dealer as many times as you can!
